#ExtraAssetsImporter
This mod let you import custom surfaces and custom decals.

# CUSTOM ASSETS AREN'T SUPPORTED BY THE GAME YET.
The assets are safe and stable to use, and won't cause any crashes or bugs. Whilst we don't expect our asset mods to break on official asset support, all modding (and unofficial modding) will always have some risk associated with it. We will do our best to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible when editor is released. When editor is released I will depcreciate this mod (but keep active for a while) and republish the assets using official pipeline.

### I'm recommending you to read this page on the website not in game, the game doesn't support all the formatting the web page does.

You can see the [trailer video](https://youtu.be/aALkRFdWOhM?si=nd_caJkElHPi6thE) made by Sully in the "MORE ABOUT THIS MOD" section.
